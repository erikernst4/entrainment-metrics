Welcome to Entrainment-Metrics documentation!
=============================================

Entrainment-Metrics is all about being able to measure entrainment. Entrainment in spoken dialogue is commonly defined as a tendency of a speaker to adapt some properties of her speech to match her interlocutor’s. With this library you'll be able to measure entrainment along one dimension: acoustic-prosodic (a/p) features.

Checkout the :ref:`getting_started` page for a deeper dive into the library!
